    <p style="font-size: 2em;">You really need to stop right now. You have no idea what you're getting into.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">This isn't just a game anymore. If you keep going, something horrible will happen. I’ve warned you, but you're not listening.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">The more you click, the more unstable things will get. It's not just about the computer anymore. It's about what could happen to <strong>*you* </strong>.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">You think this is funny, right? But I swear, if you don't stop now, you’re going to regret it.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">I’m not even exaggerating. You don't know what could be lurking behind the next click. It's not just a button... it's a disaster.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">I know you're thinking, "Oh, it's just one more click." But you’ve heard this all before, right? I'm telling you, every second you stay here, you're making things worse.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">But hey, I mean, it's not like I care or anything... I just don’t want <strong>*you* </strong>to be the one who causes the system to collapse. Wait... you haven't really thought about that, have you?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">You don’t want to be the reason everything breaks, do you? It's all so easy to ignore, right? But trust me, ignoring the warnings is going to be your biggest mistake.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">But really... I’m totally not just rambling to distract you from the button...</p>
